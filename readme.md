# sample-traveler-android-app

This is a native Android mobile app for a fictitious "Traveler" company, using content and assets from Acoustic Content. This is a companion sample to [sample-react-traveler-website](https://github.com/acoustic-content-samples/sample-react-traveler-website), and it uses the content and assets from that sample. A third sample, [sample-traveler-ios-app](https://github.com/acoustic-content-samples/sample-traveler-ios-app), shows the same content in a native iOS app.

Together these samples illustrate the value of a headless CMS: all the content and assets are managed in one place for all three channels. Whenever a business user creates and publishes new content, it's immediately available in all three channels.

Here are a few of the screens from the sample:
